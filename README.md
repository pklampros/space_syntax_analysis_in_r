## Space Syntax Analysis in R

These documents are part of a workshop that presented a workflow for working with spatial data common to the space syntax field in the R programming language.
The workshop also introduced participants to the [alcyon](https://github.com/spatialnous/alcyon) package by Petros Koutsolampros, an evolution of the [rdepthmap](https://github.com/pklampros/rdepthmap) package by Petros Koutsolampros, Fani Kostourou and Kimon Krenz.
It aimed to make participants familiar with 1) importing spatial data for urban and building scale, 2) running space syntax analysis with the rdepthmap package and 3) managing and plotting these and other related datasets.

This repository will be updated to include fixes in the library, but also new features if they are created.
To help in its development you can [sponsor my work](https://github.com/sponsors/pklampros).

- 12th Space Syntax Symposium workshop (*July 2019, Beijing, China*)
- 14th Space Syntax Symposium workshop (*June 2024, Lefkosia, Cyprus*)
